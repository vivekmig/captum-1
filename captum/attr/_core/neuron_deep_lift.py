        Implements DeepLIFT algorithm for the neuron based on the following paper:
        Learning Important Features Through Propagating Activation Differences,
        Avanti Shrikumar, et. al.
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685

        and the gradient formulation proposed in:
        Towards better understanding of gradient-based attribution methods for
        deep neural networks,  Marco Ancona, et.al.
        https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy21R9JAW

        This implementation supports only Rescale rule. RevealCancel rule will
        be supported in later releases.
        Although DeepLIFT's(Rescale Rule) attribution quality is comparable with
        Integrated Gradients, it runs significantly faster than Integrated
        Gradients and is preferred for large datasets.

        Currently we only support a limited number of non-linear activations
        but the plan is to expand the list in the future.

        Note: As we know, currently we cannot access the building blocks,
        of PyTorch's built-in LSTM, RNNs and GRUs such as Tanh and Sigmoid.
        Nonetheless, it is possible to build custom LSTMs, RNNS and GRUs
        with performance similar to built-in ones using TorchScript.
        More details on how to build custom RNNs can be found here:

        Args:

            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which layer
                        attributions are computed. If forward_func takes a
                        single tensor as input, a single input tensor should be
                        provided. If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input,
                        a tuple of the input tensors should be provided. It is
                        assumed that for all given input tensors, dimension 0
                        corresponds to the number of examples (aka batch size),
                        and if multiple input tensors are provided, the examples
                        must be aligned appropriately.
            neuron_index (int or tuple): Index of neuron in output of given
                        layer for which attribution is desired. Length of
                        this tuple must be one less than the number of
                        dimensions in the output of the given layer (since
                        dimension 0 corresponds to number of examples).
                        An integer may be provided instead of a tuple of
                        length 1.
            baselines (tensor or tuple of tensors, optional): Baselines define
                        reference samples which are compared with the inputs.
                        In order to assign attribution scores DeepLift computes
                        the differences between the inputs and references and
                        corresponding outputs.
                        If inputs is a single tensor, baselines must also be a
                        single tensor with exactly the same dimensions as inputs.
                        If inputs is a tuple of tensors, baselines must also be
                        a tuple of tensors, with matching dimensions to inputs.
                        Default: zero tensor for each input tensor
            additional_forward_args (tuple, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                        containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
                        or any arbitrary python types. These arguments are provided
                        to forward_func in order, following the arguments in inputs.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            attribute_to_neuron_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                        compute the attributions with respect to the neuron input
                        or output. If `attribute_to_neuron_input` is set to True
                        then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                        neuron's inputs, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                        to neuron's outputs.
                        Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                        or the output of internal neuron, depending on whether we
                        attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.
                        Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                        Default: False

        Returns:
            **attributions** or 2-element tuple of **attributions**, **delta**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                Computes attributions using Deeplift's rescale rule for
                particular neuron with respect to each input feature.
                Attributions will always be the same size as the provided
                inputs, with each value providing the attribution of the
                corresponding input index.
                If a single tensor is provided as inputs, a single tensor is
                returned. If a tuple is provided for inputs, a tuple of
                corresponding sized tensors is returned.

        Note that the explanation model:

            2. Is linear, meaning that the explanations are modeled through
