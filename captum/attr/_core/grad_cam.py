            Computes GradCAM attribution for chosen layer. GradCAM is designed for
            convolutional neural networks, and is usually applied to the last
            convolutional layer.

            GradCAM computes the gradients of the target output with respect to
            the given layer, averages for each output channel (dimension 2 of
            output), and multiplies the average gradient for each channel by the
            layer activations. The results are summed over all channels.

            Note that in the original GradCAM algorithm described in the paper,
            ReLU is applied to the output, returning only non-negative attributions.
            For providing more flexibility to the user, we choose to not perform the
            ReLU internally and return the sign information. To match the original
            GradCAM algorithm, it is necessary to perform ReLU on the returned
            attributions or alternatively only visualize the positive attributions.

            Note: this procedure sums over the second dimension (# of channels),
            so the output of GradCAM attributions will have a second
            dimension of 1, but all other dimensions will match that of the layer
            output.

            GradCAM attributions are generally upsampled and can be viewed as a
            mask to the input, since a convolutional layer output generally
            matches the input image spatially. This upsampling can be performed
            using LayerAttribution.interpolate, as shown in the example below.

            More details regarding the GradCAM method can be found in the
            original paper here:

            Args:

                inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which attributions
                            are computed. If forward_func takes a single
                            tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                            If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                            of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                            that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                            to the number of examples, and if multiple input tensors
                            are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
                target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                            which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                            this is usually the target class).
                            If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                            no target index is necessary.
                            For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                            - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                                integer, which is applied to all input examples

                            - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                                the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                                is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                            For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                            - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                                elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                            - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                                examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                                #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                                target for the corresponding example.

                            Default: None
                additional_forward_args (tuple, optional): If the forward function
                            requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                            which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                            can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                            argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                            tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                            tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                            are provided to forward_func in order following the
                            arguments in inputs.
                            Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                            to these arguments.
                            Default: None
                attribute_to_layer_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                            compute the attributions with respect to the layer input
                            or output. If `attribute_to_layer_input` is set to True
                            then the attributions will be computed with respect to the
                            layer input, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                            to layer output.
                            Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                            or the outputs of internal layers, depending on whether we
                            attribute to the input or output, are single tensors.
                            Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                            Default: False

            Returns:
                *tensor* of **attributions**:
                - **attributions** (*tensor*):
                            Attributions based on GradCAM method.
                            Attributions will be the same size as the
                            output of the given layer, except for dimension 2,
                            which will be 1 due to summing over channels.

                >>> # use case for GradCAM.

                >>> layer_gc = LayerGradCam(net, net.conv4)

                >>> # Computes layer GradCAM for class 3.
                >>> # attribution size matches layer output except for dimension
                >>> # 1, so dimensions of attr would be Nx1x8x8.
                >>> attr = layer_gc.attribute(input, 3)
                >>> # GradCAM attributions are often upsampled and viewed as a
                >>> # mask to the input, since the convolutional layer output

                >>> # This can be done with LayerAttribution's interpolate method.
