        Implements DeepLIFT algorithm for the layer based on the following paper:
        Learning Important Features Through Propagating Activation Differences,
        Avanti Shrikumar, et. al.
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02685

        and the gradient formulation proposed in:
        Towards better understanding of gradient-based attribution methods for
        deep neural networks,  Marco Ancona, et.al.
        https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Sy21R9JAW

        This implementation supports only Rescale rule. RevealCancel rule will
        be supported in later releases.
        Although DeepLIFT's(Rescale Rule) attribution quality is comparable with
        Integrated Gradients, it runs significantly faster than Integrated
        Gradients and is preferred for large datasets.

        Currently we only support a limited number of non-linear activations
        but the plan is to expand the list in the future.

        Note: As we know, currently we cannot access the building blocks,
        of PyTorch's built-in LSTM, RNNs and GRUs such as Tanh and Sigmoid.
        Nonetheless, it is possible to build custom LSTMs, RNNS and GRUs
        with performance similar to built-in ones using TorchScript.
        More details on how to build custom RNNs can be found here:

        Args:

            inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which layer
                        attributions are computed. If forward_func takes a
                        single tensor as input, a single input tensor should be
                        provided. If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input,
                        a tuple of the input tensors should be provided. It is
                        assumed that for all given input tensors, dimension 0
                        corresponds to the number of examples (aka batch size),
                        and if multiple input tensors are provided, the examples
                        must be aligned appropriately.
            baselines (scalar, tensor, tuple of scalars or tensors, optional):
                        Baselines define reference samples that are compared with
                        the inputs. In order to assign attribution scores DeepLift
                        computes the differences between the inputs/outputs and
                        corresponding references.
                        Baselines can be provided as:

                        - a single tensor, if inputs is a single tensor, with
                            exactly the same dimensions as inputs or the first
                            dimension is one and the remaining dimensions match
                            with inputs.

                        - a single scalar, if inputs is a single tensor, which will
                            be broadcasted for each input value in input tensor.

                        - a tuple of tensors or scalars, the baseline corresponding
                            to each tensor in the inputs' tuple can be:
                            - either a tensor with matching dimensions to
                                corresponding tensor in the inputs' tuple
                                or the first dimension is one and the remaining
                                dimensions match with the corresponding
                                input tensor.
                            - or a scalar, corresponding to a tensor in the
                                inputs' tuple. This scalar value is broadcasted
                                for corresponding input tensor.

                        In the cases when `baselines` is not provided, we internally
                        use zero scalar corresponding to each input tensor.

                        Default: None
            target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                            integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                            the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                            is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                            elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                            examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                            #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                            target for the corresponding example.
                        Default: None
            additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                        containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
                        or any arbitrary python types. These arguments are provided to
                        forward_func in order, following the arguments in inputs.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            return_convergence_delta (bool, optional): Indicates whether to return
                        convergence delta or not. If `return_convergence_delta`
                        is set to True convergence delta will be returned in
                        a tuple following attributions.
                        Default: False
            attribute_to_layer_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                        compute the attribution with respect to the layer input
                        or output. If `attribute_to_layer_input` is set to True
                        then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                        layer input, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                        to layer output.
                        Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                        or the output of internal layer, depending on whether we
                        attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.
                        Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                        Default: False
            custom_attribution_func (callable, optional): A custom function for
                        computing final attribution scores. This function can take
                        at least one and at most three arguments with the
                        following signature:
                            - custom_attribution_func(multipliers)
                            - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs)
                            - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs, baselines)
                        In case this function is not provided, we use the default
                        logic defined as: multipliers * (inputs - baselines)
                        It is assumed that all input arguments, `multipliers`,
                        `inputs` and `baselines` are provided in tuples of same length.
                        `custom_attribution_func` returns a tuple of attribution
                        tensors that have the same length as the `inputs`.
                        Default: None

        Returns:
            **attributions** or 2-element tuple of **attributions**, **delta**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                Attribution score computed based on DeepLift's rescale rule with
                respect to layer's inputs or outputs. Attributions will always be the
                same size as the provided layer's inputs or outputs, depending on
                whether we attribute to the inputs or outputs of the layer.
                If the layer input / output is a single tensor, then
                just a tensor is returned; if the layer input / output
                has multiple tensors, then a corresponding tuple
                of tensors is returned.
            - **delta** (*tensor*, returned if return_convergence_delta=True):
                This is computed using the property that the total sum of
                forward_func(inputs) - forward_func(baselines) must equal the
                total sum of the attributions computed based on DeepLift's
                rescale rule.
                Delta is calculated per example, meaning that the number of
                elements in returned delta tensor is equal to the number of
                of examples in input.
                Note that the logic described for deltas is guaranteed
                when the default logic for attribution computations is used,
                meaning that the `custom_attribution_func=None`, otherwise
                it is not guaranteed and depends on the specifics of the
                `custom_attribution_func`.

                            argument and either returns a single tensor
                            or a tuple of those.
                        The number of samples in the baselines' tensors must be
                        larger than one.

                        In the cases when `baselines` is not provided, we internally
                        use zero scalar corresponding to each input tensor.

                        Default: None
            target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                        which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                        this is usually the target class).
                        If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                        no target index is necessary.
                        For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                        - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                            integer, which is applied to all input examples

                        - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                            the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                            is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                        For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                        - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                            elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                        - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                            examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                            #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                            target for the corresponding example.

                        Default: None
            additional_forward_args (any, optional): If the forward function
                        requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                        which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                        can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                        argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a tuple
                        containing multiple additional arguments including tensors
                        or any arbitrary python types. These arguments are provided to
                        forward_func in order, following the arguments in inputs.
                        Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                        to these arguments.
                        Default: None
            return_convergence_delta (bool, optional): Indicates whether to return
                        convergence delta or not. If `return_convergence_delta`
                        is set to True convergence delta will be returned in
                        a tuple following attributions.
                        Default: False
            attribute_to_layer_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                        compute the attributions with respect to the layer input
                        or output. If `attribute_to_layer_input` is set to True
                        then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                        layer inputs, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                        to layer outputs.
                        Note that currently it assumes that both the inputs and
                        outputs of internal layers are single tensors.
                        Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                        Default: False
            custom_attribution_func (callable, optional): A custom function for
                        computing final attribution scores. This function can take
                        at least one and at most three arguments with the
                        following signature:
                            - custom_attribution_func(multipliers)
                            - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs)
                            - custom_attribution_func(multipliers, inputs, baselines)
                        In case this function is not provided, we use the default
                        logic defined as: multipliers * (inputs - baselines)
                        It is assumed that all input arguments, `multipliers`,
                        `inputs` and `baselines` are provided in tuples of same
                        length. `custom_attribution_func` returns a tuple of
                        attribution tensors that have the same length as the
                        `inputs`.
                        Default: None

        Returns:
            **attributions** or 2-element tuple of **attributions**, **delta**:
            - **attributions** (*tensor* or tuple of *tensors*):
                        Attribution score computed based on DeepLift's rescale rule
                        with respect to layer's inputs or outputs. Attributions
                        will always be the same size as the provided layer's inputs
                        or outputs, depending on whether we attribute to the inputs
                        or outputs of the layer.
                        Attributions are returned in a tuple based on whether
                        the layer inputs / outputs are contained in a tuple
                        from a forward hook. For standard modules, inputs of
                        a single tensor are usually wrapped in a tuple, while
                        outputs of a single tensor are not.
            - **delta** (*tensor*, returned if return_convergence_delta=True):
                        This is computed using the property that the
                        total sum of forward_func(inputs) - forward_func(baselines)
                        must be very close to the total sum of attributions
                        computed based on approximated SHAP values using
                        DeepLift's rescale rule.
                        Delta is calculated for each example input and baseline pair,
                        meaning that the number of elements in returned delta tensor
                        is equal to the
                        `number of examples in input` * `number of examples
                        in baseline`. The deltas are ordered in the first place by
                        input example, followed by the baseline.
                        Note that the logic described for deltas is guaranteed
                        when the default logic for attribution computations is used,
                        meaning that the `custom_attribution_func=None`, otherwise
                        it is not guaranteed and depends on the specifics of the
                        `custom_attribution_func`.
