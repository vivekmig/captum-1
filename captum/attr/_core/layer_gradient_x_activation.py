            forward_func (callable):  The forward function of the model or any
                          modification of it
            layer (torch.nn.Module): Layer for which attributions are computed.
                          Output size of attribute matches this layer's input or
                          output dimensions, depending on whether we attribute to
                          the inputs or outputs of the layer, corresponding to
                          attribution of each neuron in the input or output of
                          this layer.
                          Currently, it is assumed that the inputs or the outputs
                          of the layer, depending on which one is used for
                          attribution, can only be a single tensor.
            device_ids (list(int)): Device ID list, necessary only if forward_func
                          applies a DataParallel model. This allows reconstruction of
                          intermediate outputs from batched results across devices.
                          If forward_func is given as the DataParallel model itself,
                          then it is not neccesary to provide this argument.

            Computes element-wise product of gradient and activation for selected
            layer on given inputs.

            Args:

                inputs (tensor or tuple of tensors):  Input for which attributions
                            are computed. If forward_func takes a single
                            tensor as input, a single input tensor should be provided.
                            If forward_func takes multiple tensors as input, a tuple
                            of the input tensors should be provided. It is assumed
                            that for all given input tensors, dimension 0 corresponds
                            to the number of examples, and if mutliple input tensors
                            are provided, the examples must be aligned appropriately.
                target (int, tuple, tensor or list, optional):  Output indices for
                            which gradients are computed (for classification cases,
                            this is usually the target class).
                            If the network returns a scalar value per example,
                            no target index is necessary.
                            For general 2D outputs, targets can be either:

                            - a single integer or a tensor containing a single
                                integer, which is applied to all input examples

                            - a list of integers or a 1D tensor, with length matching
                                the number of examples in inputs (dim 0). Each integer
                                is applied as the target for the corresponding example.

                            For outputs with > 2 dimensions, targets can be either:

                            - A single tuple, which contains #output_dims - 1
                                elements. This target index is applied to all examples.

                            - A list of tuples with length equal to the number of
                                examples in inputs (dim 0), and each tuple containing
                                #output_dims - 1 elements. Each tuple is applied as the
                                target for the corresponding example.

                            Default: None
                additional_forward_args (tuple, optional): If the forward function
                            requires additional arguments other than the inputs for
                            which attributions should not be computed, this argument
                            can be provided. It must be either a single additional
                            argument of a Tensor or arbitrary (non-tuple) type or a
                            tuple containing multiple additional arguments including
                            tensors or any arbitrary python types. These arguments
                            are provided to forward_func in order following the
                            arguments in inputs.
                            Note that attributions are not computed with respect
                            to these arguments.
                            Default: None
                attribute_to_layer_input (bool, optional): Indicates whether to
                            compute the attribution with respect to the layer input
                            or output. If `attribute_to_layer_input` is set to True
                            then the attributions will be computed with respect to
                            layer input, otherwise it will be computed with respect
                            to layer output.
                            Note that currently it is assumed that either the input
                            or the output of internal layer, depending on whether we
                            attribute to the input or output, is a single tensor.
                            Support for multiple tensors will be added later.
                            Default: False

            Returns:
                *tensor* of **attributions**:
                - **attributions** (*tensor*):
                            Product of gradient and activation for each
                            neuron in given layer output.
                            Attributions will always be the same size as the
                            output of the given layer.
